	Today I made a project called Rufus. It is a dog gif where everytime you click a key he moves. I used an event listener to do so.

	I finished my project called Evolution. Using a event listener, I made it so everytime you click the picture it evolves. It starts with a underdeveloped homo sapien and ends with one of my classmates. It took me some time to figure it out but now I am comfortable making event listeners and click functions.

	I made a project called duplicator which creates a div after I type. I also put the last two projects of mine into my projects page. I will know get my website up online as soon as possible.
